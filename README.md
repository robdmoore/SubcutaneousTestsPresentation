Title
-----
Subcutaneous Testing in .NET

Description
-----------

Unit tests, integration tests, automated UI tests - we're sure you've all heard of these, but what about subcutaneous tests? We've found these tests to be incredibly useful in our crusade to spend less time writing less tests, but get a good confidence and coverage of our codebase. At the end of the day we aren't paid to write tests - we are paid to deliver business value, so we believe any techniques, like subcutaneous tests, that help us in that regard that are valuable!

We will talk about what subcutaneous tests are, why they are useful and how we write them in .NET against ASP.NET MVC and Web API. We will also cover a bunch of techniques that help us manage some of the disadvantages with this style of testing and to help make the tests manageable as your application grows in complexity.
